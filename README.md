This repository contains a fully offline simulation of a guessing game and a Selenium-based guesser that demonstrates fast automated decision-making without interacting with any live site. 
The simulation serves simple local images (by ID), and the guesser reads the image src, maps IDs to names, and submits guesses via Selenium and keyboard automation.

Disclosure: This project is a remodel of an original live-site automation script (demonstrated in the video below) and was rewritten for safety and educational purposes by ChatGPT. It demonstrates scraping, automation, 
threading, and testing practices utilized in the original program, modified for generalized usage. It is not intended for cheating or use against any live game, and the original program is and will not be used to submit any cheated records.
